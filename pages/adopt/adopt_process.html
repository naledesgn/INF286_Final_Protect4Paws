            Our Adoption Process
        </h1>
        <p>
            We practice a conversation-based adoption system here, and require in-person meetings with all potential adopters. We work to learn all about the animals in our care so that we are able to communicate their needs, their quirks, and everything wonderful about them to potential adopters- and help everyone involved find the right fit!
        </p>
        <p>
            For anyone considering adoption, we highly encourage all members of the household to come meet any potential new furry family member! These meetings can be crucial in finding the perfect match, and are especially important for dog adoptions! So long as they are up-to-date on their vaccines, you are welcome to bring your current canine companions to meet any potential canine companions- be sure to give us a heads-up if you and furry family member/s plan on stopping by!
        </p>
        <p>
            We require an Adoption Application be filled out for any adoption considerations. If we feel the fit is right and your Adoption Application is approved, we will have you fill out our Adoption Contract and will require a copy of a photo ID to keep on file. For all adoptions we will perform a two-week and 6-month Check-In, though adopters are welcome to reach out at any point in time with questions/concerns or updates!
        </p>

        <h1>
            Our Surrender Process
        </h1>
        <p>
            We accept both dogs and cats here. We primarily handle owner surrenders, while we occasionally take in known stray cats and kittens (and, unfortunately, have quite a few dumped in our parking lot throughout the year), making sure any lost pets are reunited with their owners is a priority for us. We are unable to retrieve any animals from off-site locations, and do not assist in picking up stray animals.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are looking to surrender a cat or dog to us and we have the space, we do request that you bring any and all veterinary papers/records for the animal with you. This helps us determine the best care for them and provide the best information for potential adoptions! Please note that animals with no papers will be a higher surrender fee (detailed below) as we will need to then get them to the vet for record updating and check-ups. 
        </p>
        <p>
            With such a small space and staff, we can only take in dogs 25 lbs and under. We practice a "free-range"care here for the animals, allowing everyone to stretch their legs and roam about during the day while under staff supervision, and pen everyone away for the evenings to ensure safety - as such, we require that every animal intake get along with dogs, cats, and humans of all ages. 
        </p>

        <h1>
            How Our Surrender Fees Work
        </h1>
        <p>
            We are a small non-profit running solely on donations. For all surrenders we ask for a monetary donation. These donations go directly toward our never-ending medical bills and necessary shelter supplies. You are always welcome to donate more than the given amount, and we will try our best to help when extenuating circumstances might not make the given amount feasible, but please bear in mind that our resources are limited and we will always act in the animals’ best interest when deciding where to allocate these funds. We use the following guidelines to determine the amount we ask for when surrendering an animal:
        </p>
        <p>
            -for Dogs that are spayed/neutered and up-to-date on shots = $100
            -for Dogs that are spayed/neutered but have no recent vet history = $150
            -for Dogs that are not spayed/neutered but are up-to-date on shots = $150
            -for Dogs that are not spayed/neutered and have no recent vet history = $175 
        </p>
        <p>
            -for Cats that are spayed/neutered and up-to-date on shots = $65
            -for Cats that are spayed/neutered but have no recent vet history = $85
            -for Cats that are not spayed/neutered but are up-to-date on shots = $85
            -for Cats that are not spayed/neutered and have no recent vet history = $100
